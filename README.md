i took bus at 8:30,every single day,i still didn't eat breakfast,not hungry(my stomach is terriblethough)
suprisly today my office opened earlier than usual ate a piece of bread my colleague gave me, then she left ,to airport
i read a book i had read,some sentences still make sense, then i did some normal work
this week is easier than the last , i don't know it's bad or good
now i am waiting for dinner(still don't angry,how should it come?0
